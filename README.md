# 👁️ Vision AI Guide

## Empowering the Visually Impaired with Hybrid AI.

> An accessibility tool powered by a dual-architecture system: Gemini Flash for speed and Gemini Pro for reasoning.

## 💡 What is this?
This prototype empowers visually impaired users to understand their environment in real-time. It uses the device's camera to narrate the world, acting as a digital guide.

## 🚀 The Innovation: Hybrid Architecture
To solve the trade-off between latency and precision, we implemented a "two-brain" system:

1.  **Gemini 1.5 Flash (Speed):** Handles rapid object detection and immediate voice feedback for fluid navigation and safety.
2.  **Gemini 1.5 Pro (Reasoning):** Activates for deep analysis, reading complex text (OCR), or interpreting high-context situations where detail matters more than speed.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Frontend:** React + Vite (Smooth UX)
* **Backend:** Node.js (Secure API handling)
* **AI:** Google Gemini 1.5 Flash & Pro
* **Audio:** Web Speech API / TTS
* **Live:** WebSocket integration for real-time interaction.
